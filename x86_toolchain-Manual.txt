Manual page for X86_toolchain script

This manual page was created as part of assignment 1 for Professor Lubos Kuzma. 
The page assumes a switch to x64 by default as that was my original task, but I deemed it not large enough of a contribution and I built this on top. 

 
How to install the man page:

simply type the following commands:
	cp <filename> /usr/local/man/man1/<filename>
	gzip /usr/local/man/man1/<filename>
	man <filename>
	
for shell scripts:

	install -g 0 -o 0 -m 0644 <filename> /usr/local/man/man1/
	gzip /usr/local/man/man1/<filename>
